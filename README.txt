To run site using PyCharm
1. Open entire "movie" directory as project
2. Open "fresh_tomatoes.py" in "py" directory
3. Run file with Alt-Shift-F10
4. Right click on "index.html" in main directory and select "Open in Browser"

For the last built version just open the "index.html" file in your browser.

Alternatively to run launch the site from the command line type: python entertainment_center.py
and the generated page will appear in your default browser.

That's It !




NOTES:

Becuase the data displayed in the "index.html" file is generated from python files using the .csv movie database it is crucial that these steps are done prior to viewing the website in order to display the most up to date list of movies.


Any questions please contact me using the email address above.

Enjoy the site!
